# Path-finder

This project visualizing pathfinding to find the path from a start point to a finish point on a 2D grid.
The grid contains obstacles, and some cells have weights, which increase the cost of moving through them.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

# Try it:

You can run it directly from the releases or from bin folder then debug then run pathfinding.exe.
- Press 0 to reset the grid.

# Source Code:
You will need to install the SDL2 library first and then install SDL_Image and SDL_ttf.
I recommend you to follow a tutorial to setup SDL2 Library.
After setting up the SDL2 library, just copy main.cpp, OpenSans.ttf, buttons.png from the repository to your project and build it and run the project.

# In Consideration

The code is not perfectly memory efficient, but more updates and optimization will be done soon.
